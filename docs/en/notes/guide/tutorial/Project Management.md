The system has a number of SRC targets built in.

**Project name**: custom name

**TAG**: projects will be grouped according to TAG, such as: hackerone

**Project scope**: the system will extract the root domain name of each row of targets, all scanned assets will match the root domain name and then mark the assets to which they belong, and then they can be searched on the asset page. Update asset returns will synchronize the asset ownership of the scan results.

**Logo**: fill in the project's LOGO URL link. If there is no LOGO, the LOGO will be generated based on the first letter.

**Timed task**: after the scheduled task is turned on, the targets within the project scope will be scanned regularly.

**Scan parameters**: refer to the instructions in the creation task.
